# **🧠 Fall Detection Using Deep Learning**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (fall_final.ipynb) implementing a fall detection system using deep learning techniques. The project aims to identify and classify fall activities from video or image input using a hybrid model involving human detection and action classification.

## ***📂 Project Structure***
fall_final.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook implementing the fall detection pipeline.

models/: (Optional) Folder containing YOLOv8 weights or ResNet/CNN models.

data/: (Optional) Directory containing video or image samples used for testing.

README.md: Project overview and setup guide.

## ***🚀 Features***
Real-time fall activity detection
Person detection using YOLOv8
Activity classification using ResNet-18 or CNN
Annotated frame output with class labels (e.g., falling, standing, sitting)
Designed for elder safety and smart surveillance systems

## ***🛠️ Technologies Used***
Python
OpenCV
PyTorch
YOLOv8 (via Ultralytics)
ResNet-18 / Custom CNN
Jupyter Notebook

## **🧱 Architecture Overview**
Input: Video frames captured via webcam or pre-recorded input
Person Detection: YOLOv8 draws bounding boxes and crops regions of interest
Feature Extraction and Classification: CNN or ResNet classifies the cropped image into actions (falling, walking, etc.)
Alert System (Optional): Trigger warning/log if fall detected
Display: Annotated frame with class label and confidence

## ***📊 Sample Results***
Images or video output will be displayed in the notebook showing detected human actions with bounding boxes and labels such as:
Fall Detected
Sitting
Walking
